Description: Perform model selection using distribution and probability-based methods,
	including standardized AIC, BIC, and AICc. These standardized information criteria
	allow one to perform model selection in a way similar to the prevalent "Rule of 2"
	method, but formalize the method to rely on probability theory. A novel goodness-of-fit
	procedure for assessing linear regression models is also available. This test relies on
	theoretical properties of the estimated error variance for a normal linear regression
	model, and employs a bootstrap procedure to assess the null hypothesis that the fitted
	model shows no lack of fit. For more information, see Koeneman and Cavanaugh (2023)
	<arXiv:2309.10614>. Functionality to perform all subsets linear or generalized linear
	regression is also available.
